<p>  I was born in Vallejo, California at Kaiser Permanente Medical Center on January 23, 2001. I am currently enrolled in the Girls Who Code Summer Immersion Program. I am interested in web design and software development. I participate on the girls varsity basketball and swim team. I am a 1st degree black belt in Taekwondo. 
<p> I like to play sports, hang out with friends, and watch movies. I dislike pickles, bad customer service, and rude people.
