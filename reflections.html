  <h3> Intro to Robotics <h3>
  <p> My ideas of robotics have changed because now I have a deeper understanding on how robots work. I also now know there is a lot more things you can do with robots by through programming. I think the fact that we can do so many cool things with robots such as food delivery services, movement and etc with robots makes me excited about the future about the future of robots. I think what makes me nervous is that now that robots can do what humans do but a lot more precise can put more people out of work. <p>
    <p> As far as working in groups of circuit I think what worked well was being able to colaborate with my group members. We were all able to intergate each other's ideas ihto making a workable circuit. Since it worked well, I think there is nothing that I would change about it.
     
      <h3> Intro to Robotics-Blinking LED's<h3>
        <p> In order to create a lightshow my team wrote a code and we figured out which code works best. If some parts of the code did not work we worked together to debug it. There are no improvements I would make. <p>
        <p> Some basic pieces of every Arduino sketch are the Board of Education, LED, wires, resistors, breadboard, circuits, and power connector.
          <h3>Intro to Robotics-Dance Party
            <p>I learned that a circuit is a never ending loop. My favorite part of my robot's dance is when it goes background 3 times a row and spins around in a circle.
              <h3>Django<h3>
                <p> MVC paradigm is a design pattern to relate the user interface to underlying data models.It is used to build web pages.
                  <p>The difference between a framework and a library is that a framework includes a lot of libraries. A library is a resuable piece of code that you cannot change. A framwork is a piece of code in which you dictate.
                    <p>You would use a framework instead of creating an app yourself because of security,open-sources, integration, and support.<p>
